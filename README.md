# Hey, I'm Daniel

**I'm a full-stack engineer full of passion for all aspects of building great software.** I've worked on projects of various scales, both solo and as part of a team.

[Craftsmanship](https://danieljs.me/craftsmanship-is-essential/) is something I'm passionate about and take great pride in.

Check out [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) for more details. If you're working on something cool and are looking for a developer, feel free to reach out.

## Current work

My primary project is [Dreamflow](https://dreamflow.co), which is basically my life mission. [cli-esp-trainer](https://github.com/dspacejs/cli-esp-trainer) is a similar project that's going to be interlinked with it. Besides freelancing, most of my time is spent on that.

There's also a bunch of open-source projects I'd like to build but currently don't have the time for. If you'd like to help and have a similar skillset, see my pinned repositories.
