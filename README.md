# Hey, I'm Daniel

I'm a full-stack engineer full of passion for all aspects of building great software. I've worked on projects of various scales, both solo and as part of a team.

I'm also a freelancer and available for hire. Check out [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) for more details.

My primary project is [Dreamflow](https://dreamflow.co), which is basically my life mission. Besides freelancing, most of my time is spent on that.

There's also a bunch of open-source projects I'd like to work on (but can't manage entirely myself) in the future, too. If you'd like to help, feel free to reach out.
