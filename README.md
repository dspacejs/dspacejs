# Hey, I'm Daniel

**I'm a full-stack engineer full of passion for all aspects of building great software.** I've worked on projects of various scales, both solo and as part of a team.

A bit about me:

* [Craftsmanship](https://danieljs.me/craftsmanship-is-essential/) is something I'm passionate about and take great pride in.
* My skillset extends beyond coding, such as a keen sense for design, and business intelligence.
* Freedom is a passion. I'm pro-privacy, love Linux, and only use open-source software. 
* Contributing to open-source is something I enjoy, whenever I get the chance.

Check out [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) for more details. If you're working on something cool and are looking for a developer, feel free to reach out.

## Current work

My primary project is [Dreamflow](https://dreamflow.co), which is basically my life mission. [cli-esp-trainer](https://github.com/dspacejs/cli-esp-trainer) is a similar project that's going to be interlinked with it. Besides freelancing, most of my time is spent on that.

There's also a bunch of open-source projects I'd like to build but currently don't have the time for. If you'd like to help and have a similar skillset, check out the following:
