# Hey, I'm Daniel

**I'm a full-stack engineer full of passion for all aspects of building great software.** I've worked on projects of various scales, both solo and as part of a team.

[Craftsmanship](https://danieljs.me/craftsmanship-is-essential/) is something I'm passionate about and take great pride in.
