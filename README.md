Self-taught, well-rounded senior full-stack software engineer. I do freelancing and build my own projects.

INTJ-A, vegan, addicted to learning, personal development junkie, spiritual, serious meditator, and pscyhonaut. Obssessed with consciousness.

Check out [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) to learn about me in detail.

There's also a bunch of open-source projects I'd like to build but currently don't have the time for. If you'd like to help and have a similar skillset, check out the following:
