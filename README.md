Check out [my portfolio](https://danieljs.tech) to learn about me in detail.

There's also a bunch of open-source projects I'd like to build but currently don't have the time for. If you'd like to help and have a similar skillset, check out the following:

* [snazpy](https://github.com/dspacejs/snazpy)
* [syncvibes](https://github.com/dspacejs/syncvibes)
* [cli-tarot](https://github.com/dspacejs/cli-tarot)
